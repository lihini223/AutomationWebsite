        <h1>AUTOMATION TOOLS</h1>
        <p class="p">Engineers can now have numerical control over automated devices. The result has been a rapidly expanding range of applications and human activities. Computer-aided technologies (or CAx) now serve as the basis for mathematical and organizational tools used to create complex systems. Notable examples of CAx include Computer-aided design (CAD software) and Computer-aided manufacturing (CAM software). The improved design, analysis, and manufacture of products enabled by CAx has been beneficial for industry.

        Information technology, together with industrial machinery and processes, can assist in the design, implementation, and monitoring of control systems. One example of an industrial control system is a programmable logic controller (PLC). PLCs are specialized hardened computers which are frequently used to synchronize the flow of inputs from (physical) sensors and events with the flow of outputs to actuators and events.

        Human-machine interfaces (HMI) or computer human interfaces (CHI), formerly known as man-machine interfaces, are usually employed to communicate with PLCs and other computers. Service personnel who monitor and control through HMIs can be called by different names. In industrial process and manufacturing environments, they are called operators or something similar. In boiler houses and central utilities departments they are called stationary engineers.</p>

        <h2>Different types of automation tools exist:</h2>
<ul>
       <li>ANN – Artificial Neural Network</li> 
        <li>DCS – Distributed Control System</li>
        <li>HMI – Human Machine Interface</li>
        <li>SCADA – Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition</li>
        <li>PLC – Programmable Logic Controller</li>
        <li>Instrumentation</li>
       <li> Motion control</li>
    <li> Robotics</li>
</ul>
       <p class="p"> When it comes to factory automation, Host Simulation Software (HSS) is a commonly used testing tool that is used to test the equipment software. HSS is used to test equipment performance with respect to Factory Automation standards (timeouts, response time, processing time).
